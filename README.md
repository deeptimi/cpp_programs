# cpp_programs
No matter how much content we may get online , learning from a book is mandatory for greater learning. So I bought c++ by E balaguruswamy today. I was reading from this book pdf which made me get this book.


To learn any programming language , you need to learn few things which are must for mastery:
- History of the language 
- Features
- Basic program & Tokens of the program
- Advanced and deep topics by implementing parallely
# Basic cpp program
```
#include<iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
  cout<<"This is cpp programs repository"<<endl;
  return 0;
  }
