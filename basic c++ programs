Alright, so I am using this repository for my revision purpose.
I have started studying cpp from my secondary school.
This portion will contain the basic cpp programs.

include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout<<"Hello World , This is Deepti Mishra"<<endl;
  return 0;
}

// So , basically the program will always start with header files and then I have used the using namespace std part cause if not then I'll have to write - std::cout for output and input purpose.
